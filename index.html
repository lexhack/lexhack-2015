			<h1>About</h1>
		</header>
		<div class='content'>
			<p><strong>LexHack</strong> is a hackathon targeting high school students of all programming abilities. A hackathon is an event where teams of 4 (or less) individuals work together towards development of a software application (or a hardware project if you're so inclined). At LexHack, you will have 12 hours to complete your project, after which your project will be judged by a panel of judges. These judges will then determine a winner based on the reward criteria for the event. </p>
			<p>This event is totally free; all you need to do to attend is <a href="registration.html">register here</a> and show up on September 19th at <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Lexington+High+School,+251+Waltham+St,+Lexington,+MA+02421/@42.443716,-71.2319586,17z/">Lexington High School </a> by 8:30 am. If you don't have a team, don't worry, you can find one when you arrive at the event! In that case, please try to arrive a little earlier so we can match you up with others who need a team. All we ask is that you bring a laptop and any other hardware you wish to use, as well as an open mind.</p>

			<h1>FAQ</h1>
		</header>
		<div class='container content'>
			<h3>Who can attend?</h3>
			<p>Anyone currently enrolled in high school may attend. If you're unsure about your eligibility, please <a href='mailto:info@lexhack.org'>email</a> us.</p>
			<h3>Do I need to know anything about programming to attend?</h3>
			<p>Nope! Part of the goal of LexHack is to help people learn how to quickly develop a prototype of a full application from a single idea.  We'll have plenty of mentors at the event to help you learn, and we guarantee you'll have built something awesome by the end of the day! However, we do recommend checking out sites like <a href='http://codecademy.com'>Codecademy</a> or <a href='https://code.org'>Code.org</a> to familiarize yourself with basic programming concepts. We'll also have a special award category for the best beginner project.</p>
			<h3>How much does LexHack cost?</h3>
			<p>Absolutely nothing! This is thanks to the gracious donations of our <a href='#sponsors'>sponsors</a>.</p>
			<h3>Do I need to make a team for LexHack?</h3>
			<p>Not at all! We recommend competing with a team of 4 students (or less), and if already have a team in mind, that's great! However, we've set aside time in the morning for you to meet others and form a team if you don't have one when you sign up. Just be prepared to come a little earlier (doors open at 8 am).</p>
			<h3>What technologies / programming languages do I need to use?</h3>
			<p>You can create your application using any technology you would like, as long as it meets one of two criteria for submission:
				<br>- You can provide source code that anyone can run (e.g. code in a language with a readily-available compiler)
				<br>- You can provide a working executable for Mac, Windows, Linux, iOS, or Android, as well as source we can view (e.g. a project written with a proprietary compiler, such as an iPhone app).
				<br>If you are still unsure if the programming language you wish to use is legal, please contact us.
			</p>
			<h3>How can I volunteer to mentor?</h3>
			<p>If you've graduated from high school, you can volunteer to mentor by filling out our form <a href='mentor-registration.html'>here</a>. If you're a high school student, we recommend participating in the event itself. However, if you'd prefer to mentor please contact us directly. Mentoring is a full-day commitment that involves teaching students our pre-written development curriculum and helping them with their own projects. Thanks for your interest in volunteering!</p>
			<h3>Are there other volunteer opportunities?</h3>
			<p>We could always use more hands to help facilitate the event! If you're interested in being a volunteer either in the morning, noon/afternoon, or evening (or a combination of the aforementioned) then please contact us to receive more information. High school volunteers are eligible for community service hours, and no programming experience is necessary to volunteer. </p>
			<h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
			<p>Bring yourself and any tools you need. For most, this will just be a laptop and charger. If you're more advanced and want to do a hardware project or a mobile application, bring the required equipment for these as we won't have any additional equipment available. </p>
